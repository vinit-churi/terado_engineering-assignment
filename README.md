# Image to Code Challenge by Terado Engineering

This repository contains my solution to the Image to Code Challenge provided by Terado Engineering.

## Project Overview

The project was built using the following technologies:

- Vite: A build tool that is faster and leaner, serving as a foundation to build tools like React.
- React Router DOM: Declarative routing for React.
- Recharts: A composable charting library built on React components.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Material-UI DataGrid: A fast and flexible data table for React.
